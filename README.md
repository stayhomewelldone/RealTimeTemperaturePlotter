# RealTimeTemperaturePlotter
Code for Real-Time Temperature Visualization using Sense HAT and Matplotlib.

This code collects temperature data from a Sense HAT sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi. It creates a real-time animated plot using Matplotlib to visualize the temperature data as it changes over time. The plot displays timestamps on the x-axis and temperature values on the y-axis. The animation updates every 10 seconds with new temperature readings from the sensor, creating a dynamic visualization of temperature fluctuations.
